### On premises environment

- Hardware
    - at least one servers with 8 Cores and 64 GB RAM
- Software    
    - VMware VCenter 6.5 + ESXi + VMware HCX ( NSX is not required for this lab ) 


### On VMware Cloud on AWS

- The stack created is enough, just need to deploy the HCX on portal and open the firewall ports to access the vCenter and HCX, I'll explain it in the next chapter
